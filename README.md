## ABOUT OUR PROJECT
The project aim is to provide security measures for networks by monitoring incoming network traffic, protecting it from unauthorized access and external threats. The firewall application acts as gatekeeper analyzing the potentially malicious or suspicious traffic and ensuring the security, integrity and availability of device networks and the sensitive data they contain. The design and development of an IoT-based firewall for network security can contribute to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but the most suitable one would be SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. SDG 9 aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. The design and development of network security technologies, such as firewalls, are essential components of achieving this goal. Ensuring the security and reliability of communication networks and other critical infrastructure is vital for sustainable economic growth, social development, and environmental protection.
